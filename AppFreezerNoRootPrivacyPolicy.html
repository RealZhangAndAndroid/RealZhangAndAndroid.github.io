This app uses Accessibility services
This app is a great automated solution for users with physical disabilities and muscle fatigue, who struggle while interacting with the screen, especially when doing repetitive complicated tasks such as force closing many apps one by one.
</p>
<p>
This app automates one of the most repeating task with the user-interface , the task of "force closing running apps" ! and It does so, by closing all the apps, one by one in an automated way, and hence helps disabled users avoid to manually close each app in the system settings.
